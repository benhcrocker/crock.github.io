Turning real-world urgency into cybersecurity vigilance.

Projects, Home Labs, and Ongoing Education:

Live SOC Monitoring – LetsDefend

In this hands-on simulation, I operated within a live Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using LetsDefend. I monitored real-time alerts across multiple attack vectors, performed structured triage, and conducted incident investigations aligned with blue team workflows. This experience sharpened my ability to distinguish false positives from genuine threats, apply containment strategies, and document findings with precision — all while reinforcing my understanding of SOC roles and escalation protocols.

SOC Analyst Simulation – TryHackMe

This immersive simulation challenged me to investigate realistic cyber incidents using SIEM and EDR tools in a virtual SOC setting. I analyzed system and network logs, identified indicators of compromise, and responded to threats ranging from malware infections to privilege escalation attempts. The exercise emphasized threat detection, root cause analysis, and incident response documentation — strengthening my operational readiness for real-world SOC analyst responsibilities.

Cybersecurity Lab Environment – Tool Familiarization & VM Hardening

I built a dedicated virtual lab using VMware Workstation Pro to explore and simulate cybersecurity workflows. Within this hardened VM, I installed and configured a comprehensive suite of tools including Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, OpenVAS, OllyDbg, Procmon, RegShot, and others to deepen my familiarity with network analysis, vulnerability scanning, reverse engineering, and system monitoring. I implemented snapshot checkpoints to ensure safe rollback during experimentation and applied hardening techniques to reduce attack surface — reinforcing best practices for secure lab environments and tool-based threat analysis.


Web Development & Security Fundamentals – GitHub Page Project

To strengthen my understanding of web technologies and application security, I created a personal GitHub page at benhcrocker.github.io. Through this project, I explored the basics of HTML structure, styling, and deployment workflows using GitHub Pages. As part of my cybersecurity learning path, I also began studying common web application vulnerabilities — including cross-site scripting (XSS) — and how secure coding practices, input validation, and proper configuration can mitigate these risks. This foundational experience supports my broader goal of mastering web-based threat detection and secure development principles.

Python Programming – Gamified Learning & Skill Expansion

To build on the foundational 20 hours of Python training from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I’ve committed to weekly practice on Boot.dev’s gamified learning platform since early November. I spend 2–3 hours each week solving progressively complex challenges that reinforce core programming concepts, data structures, and control flow — all within an interactive, story-driven environment. This consistent engagement is strengthening my scripting fluency and preparing me to apply Python in cybersecurity contexts such as automation, log parsing, and threat detection.

Threat Intelligence Exploration – ANY.RUN Deep Analysis VM

To expand my exposure to real-world malware behavior and threat intelligence workflows, I obtained personal access to ANY.RUN’s interactive sandbox environment. This platform allows me to analyze suspicious files and URLs in a deep analysis virtual machine, observe dynamic malware execution, and review behavioral indicators across network, registry, and process activity. By leveraging ANY.RUN’s threat feeds and analysis tools, I’m strengthening my ability to recognize malicious patterns, validate IOCs, and understand adversary tactics — all critical skills for proactive SOC operations and incident response.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
